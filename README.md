# Payload Processor PCB

The firmware for the Payload Processor was developed using the ESP-IDF extension for VS Code to build and upload the code to the ESP32 microprocessor. The ESP32-Pico-D4 development kit was used to test and debug the firmware while the Payload component is being developed.

The PCB for the Payload Processor was developed using Altium for JLCPCB 7628. It is built around an ESP32-Pico-D4 microprocessor. The schematic design is adapted from the devkit reference design to support the needs of CubeSTEP. The PCB is designed around the PC104 spec.

## To Do

* Get PCB Manufactured
* Test PCB
* Refine and update for production

## [Firmware](https://github.com/23navin/CubeSTEP-payload-firmware)

This hardware was designed around an existing test setup and the linked firmware. The firmware was developed to support all the requirements of the project.
